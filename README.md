Code and data accompanying the manuscript "Longitudinal development of category representations in ventral temporal cortex predicts word and face recognition" 


The code was developed and tested in MATLAB version 2017b.  
Here we provide the code necessary to generate the main figures. Some of the functions use the cbrewer color schemes, which can be found here (https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34087-cbrewer-colorbrewer-schemes-for-matlab). Please make sure to download these and add them to your path before you begin.

Please also make sure to add the 'helperFunctions' folder to your path.
